Recommended Questions (General Preparation)

Here is a general list of types of problems often used for senior backend interviews, focusing on data structures and efficient algorithms:
Category 	Problem Title	Difficulty
Arrays/Matrix	Spiral Matrix	Medium
Arrays	Product of Array Except Self	Medium
Strings	Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters	Medium
Data Structures	LRU Cache	Medium
Trees/Graphs	Binary Tree Level Order Traversal	Medium
Graphs	Number of Islands	Medium
Linked Lists	Merge k Sorted Lists	Hard
Dynamic Programming	Coin Change	Medium
Concurrency	Design Bounded Blocking Queue	Medium


Beyond LeetCode: System Design and Java Concepts 
For a Senior Backend Java Developer role, coding challenges are only one part of the interview. You will also be heavily assessed on:
Core Java: Concurrency (multi-threading, thread pools, locks, synchronizers), Garbage Collection, JVM internals.
System Design: Designing scalable, reliable, and fault-tolerant distributed systems (e.g., e-commerce platforms, payment systems).
Technologies: Spring Framework, databases (SQL/NoSQL), messaging queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), microservices architecture, and API design. 
Focus your preparation on practicing the general problem types listed above and ensuring you can discuss trade-offs, time complexity, and practical Java implementations.
While specific questions can vary, the senior backend Java interviews at eBay typically focus on a mix of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), System Design, and core Java/OOP concepts. The LeetCode questions usually range from Medium to Hard difficulty, covering areas such as Arrays, Hashmaps, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming. 
Here is a list of representative LeetCode questions in markdown format that are suitable for preparing for a Senior Backend Java role at eBay:
Question 	Difficulty	Category	LeetCode Link
Two Sum	Easy	Array / Hash Table	Link
LRU Cache	Medium	Design / Hash Table / Linked List	Link
Merge Intervals	Medium	Array / Intervals	Link
Number of Islands	Medium	Graph / BFS / DFS	Link
Top K Frequent Elements	Medium	Hash Table / Heap	Link
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters	Medium	String / Sliding Window	Link
Product of Array Except Self	Medium	Array	Link
Course Schedule	Medium	Graph / Topological Sort	Link
Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree	Hard	Tree / Design / DFS/BFS	Link
Clone Graph	Medium	Graph	Link
Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum	Hard	Tree / DFS	Link
Partition Equal Subset Sum	Medium	Dynamic Programming	Link
Key Preparation Areas:
Core Data Structures & Algorithms: Be prepared to discuss time/space complexity and write clean, testable Java code for common algorithms and data structures.
System Design: Senior roles heavily emphasize system design (e.g., designing a notification service or an online flash sale system). DSA questions will often be integrated into these discussions.
Java/OOPs Concepts: Expect deep dives into core Java concepts (interfaces vs. abstract classes, memory management, multi-threading, etc.).
Real-world application: Interviewers often look for overall development practices, including unit tests and class design, not just the most optimized algorithm solution.
