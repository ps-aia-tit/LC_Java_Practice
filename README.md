## 🧠 Beyond LeetCode: System Design & Java Concepts

Senior Backend Java interviews assess more than coding:

- **Core Java**: Concurrency (thread pools, locks), Garbage Collection, JVM internals
- **System Design**: Scalable, fault-tolerant systems (e.g., e-commerce, payments)
- **Technologies**: Spring Framework, SQL/NoSQL, Kafka/RabbitMQ, microservices, API design
